instantly is a simple tool that makes it incredibly quick and easy to create, manage, and share project templates and setup projects.
It provides a command line tool, Python API, and web-interface so you can expand templates exactly where you need to.
It currently cleanly supports Python 2.6 - 3.4 using pies (https://github.com/timothycrosley/pies) to achieve this without ugly hacks and/or py2to3.
